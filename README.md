# Code Quiz [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
We have created a platform where students can boost their knowledge of coding while answering complex true or false questions, tracking progress, while protecting their progress. 

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (Node.js, express.js)
* Sequelize as the ORM
* Handlebars.js as the templating language
* Express-session npm package for authentication
* Tailwind CSS
* Chart.js

## Description 

This app allows users to sign up using their email address. Users can then take the quiz multiple times and track their progress. The Quiz never ends; as soon the user arswered all the unique questions in a random order, questions are repeated in a rendom order again. Users can also add their own question to the questions table. Code Quiz app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure.
